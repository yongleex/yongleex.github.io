### Hello! I'm Yong Lee (李勇)

I am a free researcher at present. I received my BSc degree at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2012, and Ph.D. degree in the School of Mechanical Science and Engineering at HUST in 2018, under the joint supervision of [Prof. Youlun Xiong](http://mse.hust.edu.cn/info/1142/1326.htm) and [Prof. Hua Yang](http://mse.hust.edu.cn/info/1142/1332.htm). I worked at [Cobot](https://www.cobotsys.com/) (Wuhan Cobot Technology Co., Ltd.) as an algorithm scientist from 2018 to 2019. As a postdoctoral research fellow, I worked in the Department of Computer Science at National University of Singapore (NUS) with [Prof. Harold Soh](https://haroldsoh.com/) from 2019 to 2020.

My research interests include image processing, particle image velocimetry, robot learning, and deep learning.
